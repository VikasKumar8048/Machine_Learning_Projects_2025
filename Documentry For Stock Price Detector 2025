Note: In this Stock price pridictor Lasso regression is not work properly 
due to following reasons :
This causes Lasso to:

Shrink less-important coefficients to zero (feature elimination)

Prefer sparse models — great for high-dimensional datasets (like text, genes, etc.)

Can over-penalize when:

The number of features is small

Features are highly correlated (which is the case here)

The default regularization strength (alpha=1.0) is too high

🔬 Why Lasso Performs Poorly Here
Cause	Explanation
❗ Few Features	Lasso tries to shrink coefficients to zero, but when there are only 4 features, this can lead to underfitting.
🔗 Highly Correlated Inputs	Lasso arbitrarily picks one correlated feature and eliminates the rest — even if they’re all important (e.g., Open, High, Low are all predictive of Close)
🧪 Default alpha is too aggressive	If you don't tune alpha, Lasso might penalize too harshly.
